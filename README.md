Specialist Performance Auditor
Project Overview: A Python-based tool designed to track and audit physical performance data. The system calculates total session volume, tracks maximum weight for individual sets, and identifies targets for progressive overload.

Features:

Volume Auditing: Calculates total weight displaced per exercise and per session.

Progressive Overload Logic: Automatically generates targets for subsequent sessions based on a 2.5% to 5% increase.

Granular Tracking: Monitors repetitions and maximum weight reached for both upper and lower body muscle groups.
